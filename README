Our own movie/animation:
Kites fly overhead as a kite flies in the wind on a bright, sunny day.

The basic structure consists of the following parts:
Environment:
The environment contains a sky, a ground, and a sun. These are all
stationary.

Clouds:
Clouds are easily created by giving a center point and a time offset to
our create_cloud constructor. This creates four ellipses that are grouped
together to form a single object that moves as a function of time, giving the
appearance of a cloud.

Kite:
The kite consists of two halfs and a string. These are created from polygons,
and they move as a function of time, as if swaying in the wind.
